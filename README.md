Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing an AI model capable of recognizing three animal categories: cats, dogs, and parrots. Built using Google Teachable Machine, it provides a foundation for applications in wildlife monitoring, pet identification, and various animal recognition tasks.

Data Collection & Training Process:
To create an effective model, a well-curated dataset was assembled with images of diverse breeds, colors, and poses of cats, dogs, and parrots. The model was trained on Google Teachable Machine, which allowed for a no-code approach that streamlined the development process and facilitated optimization. The training focused on achieving a balanced model capable of accurate predictions while minimizing errors across all three classes.

Model Evaluation:
With an impressive F1 score of 1.0, this animal recognition model now achieves perfect precision and recall, demonstrating a high level of reliability suitable for real-world applications where accurate animal identification is essential. Future improvements may include expanding the model to recognize additional animal species or enhancing its robustness through even larger, more diverse datasets.

Applications & Future Potential:
This model is immediately applicable in areas such as wildlife conservation, where it could assist in tracking species in real-time. It may also be valuable in mobile apps for animal identification for pet owners and enthusiasts, as well as educational tools designed for learning about animals.
