Project Overview: 
                 This project centers on developing an AI model capable of recognizing three animal categories: cats, dogs, and parrots. Built using Google Teachable Machine, it serves as a foundational system for applications in wildlife 
                 monitoring, pet identification, and other animal-related recognition tasks.

Data Collection & Training Process:
                                   To create an effective model, a well-curated dataset was gathered. The dataset consisted of images representing diverse breeds, colors, and poses of cats, dogs, and parrots to improve the model's 
                                   robustness. Each image was labeled accurately before training, ensuring high data quality. The model was trained on Google Teachable Machine, leveraging its no-code interface to streamline the development 
                                   process and focus on optimization. This training aimed to achieve a balanced model capable of accurate predictions while minimizing errors across all three classes.

Model Evaluation:
                 With an F1 score of 0.84, this animal recognition model demonstrates a reliable balance of accuracy and recall, making it suitable for real-world uses where accurate animal identification is essential. Future improvements 
                 could include expanding the model to recognize additional animal species or further refining its accuracy through larger, more diverse datasets..

Applications & Future Potential:
                                This model has immediate applications in fields like wildlife conservation, where it could assist in tracking animal species in real-time, or in mobile apps that identify animals in photos for pet owners or 
                                enthusiasts. The model could also be integrated into educational tools for learning about animals.
